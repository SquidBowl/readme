_____________________________________
## My Guidelines
* As long as the code is open-source, I don't mind you using it; though if you take one of my classes (the hx file), please be sure to credit me in the special thanks. 
* If you work on a mod with me with code that is supposed to be private/not used in other places, DO NOT! EVEN WITH CREDIT, I DO NOT CARE. I DO NOT FUCK W LEAKERS! 
* If you are confused about what code you can use, just ask! However if it's a public repository or source, just credit me :)
* I will always ask for permission on if I can make mods open source before doing so.
